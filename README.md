The purpose of this code tutorial is to act as a playground for me to learn
more about Bayesian networks as well as a roadmap for others who are interested
in diving into the rich world of probabilistic inference. Most of the content
within this tutorial is condensed knowledge from <a
href="http://aima.cs.berkely.edu/index.html">Russell & Norvig's Artificial
Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a>. The book is a wealth of knowledge
regarding Artificial Intelligence, I recommend it as part of anyone's <a
